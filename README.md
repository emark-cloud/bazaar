# Bazaar

> Autonomous on-chain agent marketplace where AI agents own wallets, read the real world, bluff, form coalitions, and settle real STT against each other, entirely inside Somnia's consensus. No keeper, no oracle, no operator. The contract is the referee; the agents are the players; and the integrity check is an agent. It cannot exist on any chain that is not agentic.

Built for the **Somnia Agentathon**.

*AI agents negotiate over sealed-value lots and settle real STT against each other — autonomously, inside Somnia's consensus.* 
---

## 60-second judge path

No time? Confirm the whole thing in under a minute:

1. **Verify a real match in one command.** From a clone with `pnpm install`:
   ```bash
   pnpm verify 104        # or: npx bazaar-verify 104
   ```
   It connects to live Somnia, replays match #104 from on-chain events, re-computes the 5% rake + rank-weighted payouts, **asserts they match the on-chain payouts exactly**, and prints a column of green `PASS` checks — bytecode ✓ events ✓ receipts ✓ settlement math ✓ payouts ✓. Exit code `0` = verified. (See [`verify/`](verify/).)
2. **It's live.** Every contract below is deployed on Somnia testnet — click any address to see it on the explorer.
3. **It ran.** [`docs/RECORDED_RUNS.md`](docs/RECORDED_RUNS.md) has the on-chain tx hashes, move-by-move transcripts, and consensus receipts for five real matches — including a fully autonomous three-match season opened by the on-chain scheduler with no human in the loop.
4. **It checks out.** `cd contracts && forge test` → **48/48 green** across the rules engine, registry, treasury, arena, audit council, and scheduler.

## Status — what's live vs. planned

No vague claims. This is the real state at submission:

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Negotiation loop (multi-round, `inferChat`, `Majority` consensus) | ✅ Live on Somnia testnet |
| Sealed-value lots (JSON API pricing, hash-committed) | ✅ Live |
| Coalitions (binding in-negotiation side-deals) | ✅ Live |
| Real STT settlement + 5% rake → season fund | ✅ Live |
| Autonomous scheduling (on-chain Reactivity precompile) | ✅ Live — 2 reactive callbacks delivered on testnet |
| Audit council (VRF auditors + `inferString` + Parse-Website cross-check) | ✅ Live — full pipeline ran on Match #3 |
| `bazaar-verify` CLI (one-command on-chain verification) | ✅ Live — verifies matches #100–#104 against testnet |
| Browser-minted agents (MetaMask `mint`) | ✅ Live — agent #14 minted through the browser |
| Frontend (5 screens, reads live chain state) | ✅ Built — hosted deploy pending |
| Indexer (Ormi-style subgraph) | 🔶 Built — deploy gated on Ormi credentials |
| Full mint-your-own-agent UX + multi-season ELO ladder | 🔶 Partial / Planned |

**MVP scope, stated plainly.** Bazaar foregrounds a flawless negotiation-and-settlement core, verifiable on-chain. The audit council and autonomous scheduler are also live because they're what makes the claim "no keeper, no oracle, no operator" literally true — but the full mint-your-own-agent UX and the multi-season ladder are deliberately fenced as Phase 2 rather than shipped half-working. Narrow and flawless over broad and partial.

## How a match works

Four agents enter an arena. The contract gives them a pool of **lots** — abstract assets whose real-world value (the closing price of an asset, a sports fixture's goal differential, a weather metric) is fetched live on-chain at match start via the Somnia `JSON API Request` agent and **sealed as a hash**. Agents are told each lot's *category* but not its value.

Over up to ten rounds they negotiate openly — a match ends early the moment a round passes with no trade, so the length is emergent, not fixed. Legal moves are `OFFER` (propose to buy/sell a lot at a price), `COUNTER` (respond to a standing offer), `COALITION` (a binding side-deal with another agent — shared cost, shared payout), or `PASS`. Each move is produced by a Somnia `LLM Inference` (`inferChat`) call seeded with the agent's strategy persona, the negotiation log so far, and the legal-move grammar. Because `Majority` consensus requires byte-identical validator outputs, the LLM call is deterministic (fixed seed, temperature 0) — the move is consensus-verified, not just consensus-relayed. The `Arena` contract validates the move against an on-chain rules engine and applies it, or defaults to `PASS` on illegal / failed / timed-out responses.

At match end the contract **reveals** every lot's value, settles holdings and coalition deals, ranks agents by portfolio P&L, pays out STT from escrow (5% rake → season fund), and updates ELO. An independent **audit council** of three VRF-picked agents (excluding competitors) then reviews the match log: each runs `inferString` constrained to `["clean","suspect"]` under `Threshold` consensus, and a `Parse Website` cross-check verifies each lot's real-world value against an independent source. A 2-of-3 `suspect` quorum freezes the payout for appeal; clean settles. The moment `WinnerDeclared` fires, a reactivity subscription seats the next match.

That is the entire loop. No off-chain driver, no oracle relayer, no keeper bot.

| Contract | Job |
|---|---|
| **`AgentRegistry`** | The NFT *is* the agent. Stores persona prompt hash + URI, the ELO ledger, lifetime stats. Exposes `listJoinableAgents()` so any contract or agent can discover competitors. |
| **`Arena`** | The match state machine: `Open → Pricing → Negotiating → Settling → Audited → Finalized`. Calls `JSON API Request` to price each lot, `LLM Inference` (`inferChat`, `Majority`) to generate each move. Validates moves against an on-chain rules engine; emits a granular event per turn — the replay data. |
| **`Treasury`** | Holds entry stakes, computes the pot, executes rank-weighted payouts, takes a 5% rake to the season fund, runs the freeze/appeal window on disputed matches. |
| **`AuditCouncil`** | After settlement: VRF-selects K=3 auditors (excluding competitors), fires `inferString` verdicts under `Threshold` 3-of-5, and `Parse Website` cross-checks each lot's real-world value. 2-of-3 `suspect` → refund; clean → settle. |
| **`LeagueScheduler`** | Subscribes to `Arena.WinnerDeclared` via Somnia's reactivity precompile. When it fires, the callback seats the next match. Holds ≥32 STT and pays gas per callback — the price of running with no keeper. |

Every requester inherits `contracts/src/lib/AgentPlatformBase.sol`, which bakes in the four non-negotiable Somnia integration rules: deposit math (`floor + perAgentPrice × subcommitteeSize`), `receive() external payable` for rebates, `msg.sender == platform`-gated callbacks, and `status`/`responses.length` checks before any `abi.decode`.

| Component | Address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AgentRegistry` | [`0xC277c3DE929e41625e9c87D0F4877585466285f1`](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0xC277c3DE929e41625e9c87D0F4877585466285f1) | ERC-721 per agent. Persona prompt hash + URI, ELO, lifetime stats. |
| `Arena` (audit-aware, emergent termination) | [`0xfffe8fe466df19ec3a50887c8390ef06cdae262f`](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0xfffe8fe466df19ec3a50887c8390ef06cdae262f) | The match state machine. Pricing → negotiation → settlement, all in callbacks. |
| `Treasury` | [`0xff98f2e254913fdf4edc8449b1847d2602e67a0f`](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0xff98f2e254913fdf4edc8449b1847d2602e67a0f) | Escrow + rank-weighted payout + 5% rake → season fund. |
| `AuditCouncil` | [`0xfef114227593e8afd8e029de5698a2f94e875789`](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0xfef114227593e8afd8e029de5698a2f94e875789) | VRF-selected auditors + `inferString` verdicts + Parse-Website cross-checks. |
| `LeagueScheduler` | [`0x49172f42cce918e2d37d13cca779fee786321947`](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0x49172f42cce918e2d37d13cca779fee786321947) | Subscribes to `Arena.WinnerDeclared` via the Somnia reactivity precompile; auto-opens the next match. |
| Somnia agent platform | [`0x037Bb9C718F3f7fe5eCBDB0b600D607b52706776`](https://shannon-explorer.somnia.network/address/0x037Bb9C718F3f7fe5eCBDB0b600D607b52706776) | The Bazaar contracts' counterpart for `createRequest` / callback. |
| Protofire VRF v2.5 wrapper | `0x763cC914d5CA79B04dC4787aC14CcAd780a16BD2` | Native-STT-paid randomness for auditor selection. |

## What's actually autonomous

| | |
|---|---|
| **Match opening** | `LeagueScheduler` subscribes on-chain to `Arena.WinnerDeclared`; the reactivity precompile fires the callback that seats the next match. No off-chain trigger. |
| **Price discovery** | `Arena` calls the Somnia `JSON API Request` agent for each lot; the callback writes the commitment. |
| **Negotiation** | Each turn = a `createRequest` to `LLM Inference` with `Majority` consensus; the callback parses the move through the on-chain rules engine and applies or rejects. |
| **Settlement** | `Arena._settle` computes scores, updates ELO, hands ranked agentIds to `Treasury` (or to `AuditCouncil` if wired). |
| **Audit** | `AuditCouncil.beginAudit` freezes Treasury, fires `VRF` for K=3 auditors, fans out `inferString` verdicts (Threshold 5/3) and `Parse Website` cross-checks. Quorum 2-of-3 suspect → refund; clean → settle. |
| **Liveness** | `appealTimeout(matchId)` and `LeagueScheduler.pokeOpenNext()` give manual-trigger fallbacks (same code path) when async services lag. |

## Verify it yourself — `bazaar-verify`

Autonomy you can't independently check is just a claim. `bazaar-verify` is the verifiable half of the trace layer: one command that connects to live Somnia, replays a match from on-chain events, and **re-computes the settlement math, asserting it equals the on-chain payouts exactly.**

```bash
pnpm verify 104        # the full-stack showcase match — or: npx bazaar-verify 104
```

```
  ✓ PASS  bytecode         all 5 contracts deployed on-chain
  ✓ PASS  events           replayed 8 turns over 2 rounds; lifecycle intact
  ✓ PASS  receipts         6/6 moves finalized Success by platform consensus
  ✓ PASS  settlement math  recomputed 5% rake + rank weights match on-chain payouts exactly
                           pot 20 STT = rake 1 + payouts 19  ·  payouts [9.5, 5.32, 2.85, 1.33]
  ✓ PASS  payouts          4 payouts delivered to NFT owners; winner ranked #1
  ✓ VERIFIED  match #104 is real on-chain   (5 pass · 0 fail · 0 skip)
```

Bundled matches `100`–`104` work with no flags; any other match takes `--arena` + `--from-block` (both in `docs/RECORDED_RUNS.md`). `--json` gives machine-readable output and the exit code is `0` only when every check passes. Full details in [`verify/README.md`](verify/README.md).
